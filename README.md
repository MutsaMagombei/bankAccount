# bankAccount
A simple program I made in first year. The programme allows a user to create and manage a bank account.
The program uses a menu loop to allow the user to:
1. Create an account (using function **createAccount**)
2. Deposit money into the account (using function **depositMoney**)
3. Withdraw money from the account (using function **withdrawMoney**)
4. Check the current balance (using function **checkBalance**)
5. Display account details (using function **displayAccountDetails**)
6. Exit the program
